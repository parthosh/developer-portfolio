            <h3>A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops</h3>
            <p>Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn. Memories fade with time and
                lessons
                are forgotten, but experiences shape a human being and leave a lasting mark. Teachers have the privilege
                of
                guiding early experiences and discoveries.</p>

                planning for a lifetime, educate people. Education is not preparation for life; education is life
                itself.</p>

                <p>Teachers' self-reported assessment practices and the influence of teaching experience, grade level,
                    and
                    subject area on those practices were explored in this study. Questionnaires were administered to 893
                    teachers in 34 schools. Teachers reported using performance and observation-based assessment methods
                    most frequently and had the most confidence in the validity of these assessment techniques. </p>

                <p>If teachers are to prepare an ever more diverse group of students for much more challenging work—for
                    framing problems; finding, integrating and synthesizing information; creating new solutions;
                    learning on
                    their own; and working cooperatively—they will need substantially more knowledge and radically
                    different
                    skills than most now have and most schools of education now develop.</p>
