            <h3>A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops</h3>
            <p>Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn. Memories fade with time and
                lessons
                are forgotten, but experiences shape a human being and leave a lasting mark. Teachers have the privilege
                of
                guiding early experiences and discoveries.</p>

            <h3>Teaching is the greatest act of optimism</h3>
            <p>If you are planning for a year, sow rice; if you are planning for a decade, plant trees; if you are
                planning for a lifetime, educate people. Education is not preparation for life; education is life
                itself.</p>
